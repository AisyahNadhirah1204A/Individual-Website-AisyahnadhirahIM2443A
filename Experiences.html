                try to become more active and at the same time I want to stay in hostel. I learnt various things about health because we as a komander must have the skills, and basic
              to help people such as injured people. We also held so many programs and exhibition about health to students of UiTM Kedah and I am an EXCO logistic which arranged the schedule
